## [Introduction]{.text-lg .font-bold}
<br>

In November 2023, a friend of mine originally planned to visit Macau with another friend, but due to unforeseen circumstances, he had to cancel. He asked if I was interested in joining him instead. I had never been to Macau before, and since it was a short trip, I decided to tag along for this spontaneous adventure.

## [Arriving in Macau]{.text-lg .font-bold}
<br>

Upon arrival in Macau, I noticed many hotel shuttle buses near the airport, making it unnecessary to take a taxi. We stayed at Studio City.

After checking in, the room wasn’t luxurious, but it was very comfortable. We had a great view of the Eiffel Tower at The Parisian, giving a little taste of Paris in Macau.

After settling in, it was time to replenish our energy with some food. Since it was quite late, most of the restaurants at Studio City were already closed. We decided to take a taxi to Galaxy Macau, where the restaurants were still open. We ended up choosing Tsui Wah Restaurant, which is located next to a casino. After checking the menu, it became clear that prices in Macau are quite high compared to Taiwan. We ordered two bowls of fish ball noodles and two milk teas, which cost 165 MOP (around 650 NTD).

<br>

After dinner, we wandered around the casino. The minimum bet at the tables was 300-500 HKD, which was a bit much for us, so we tried our luck at the slot machines. One hundred HKD disappeared quickly, but at least the casino offered free drinks, which was a nice perk.

We called it a night and returned to the hotel to rest.

<br>

## [Day Two]{.text-lg .font-bold}

<br>

The second day was mostly spent at Studio City’s water park, so we didn’t venture too far. Before that, we headed to the Taipa city center for lunch.

<br>

We found a well-reviewed curry beef offal stall in the city center and decided to give it a try. It wasn’t cheap!

<br>

Afterward, we tried one of Macau’s most famous dishes, water crab congee. 

Although tasty, it wasn’t as impressive as I had hoped.

<br>

We then headed to a well-known café, Wong Kei Coffee, for some drinks.

<br>

After wandering around, we headed back to Studio City to enjoy the water park. Since it was November, only the indoor portion was open, but it was still a fun experience. However, the lack of goggles made it difficult to see clearly on some rides, which took away from the experience.

<br>

<br>

After a few rides, I started feeling a bit dizzy due to the limited visibility, so I took a break. It was a bit of a letdown, but still fun overall.

In the evening, we had dim sum for dinner. It was decent, but the bill came to around 900 MOP...

晚餐後，我們決定去各大賭場踩點，每個賭場的裝潢都金碧輝煌，真不愧是賭城！雖然沒有大手筆下注，但這些華麗的場景讓人印象深刻。

<br>

We strolled around and eventually returned to Studio City, but only checked out the casino there without betting. Feeling tired, we headed to bed.

<br>

## [Day Three]{.text-lg .font-bold}

<br>

Today was our last day in Macau. In the morning, we used a McDonald’s coupon from the Studio City app to get a milkshake, which is no longer available in Taiwan, for 100 MOP.

<br>


We didn’t order much, as we planned to head to the old city area. After eating, we took a casino shuttle bus to the old city district. Once there, we had lunch at a well-reviewed local restaurant.

<br>

<br>

After lunch, we visited the iconic Ruins of St. Paul’s for some sightseeing and photos. The place was packed with people.

<br>

After taking pictures, we walked around the area but didn’t find much to buy compared to Japan. We did pick up Macau’s famous Portuguese egg tarts, though.

<br>

Towards the end of our trip, we visited MGM Casino and enjoyed free bubble tea and snacks. I played a few rounds on the slot machines and surprisingly won back the money I lost the day before, which was a nice little bonus.

My friend initially won but eventually lost it all, proving that gambling should only be done in moderation.

And with that, our Macau trip came to an end.


<br>

## [Final Thoughts]{.text-lg .font-bold}

<br>

A three-day, two-night trip to Macau is more than enough time. Aside from the casinos, the rest of the attractions can be seen rather quickly. I later found out that some frequent gamblers actually use their winnings to pay for their hotel stays, but that would require a significant bankroll!

This trip was an eye-opener for me when it comes to casinos. I saw quite a few high-rollers with stacks of chips worth thousands. For someone like me with a modest budget, I may not have gambled heavily, but the trip was still full of excitement and new experiences.

Thanks my friend!

Looking forward to the next trip!
