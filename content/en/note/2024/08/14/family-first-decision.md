# [Putting Family First: The Decision to Resign and What It Taught Me]{.text-xl .font-bold}
<br>

The sudden news of my family member being diagnosed with a lung tumor.

Initially, she chose not to pursue further treatment since the tumor was small.  

## [The Turn of Events]{.text-lg .font-bold}
<br>
In July this year, my family member's condition suddenly worsened, and their health declined rapidly.

At that time, I had just started a new job less than a year ago.

The company was a startup, so the pace was actually faster than that of traditional companies.

However, my family member's illness began to affect my ability to focus daily.

Due to my family member's physical weakness

I had to take on all household chores and frequently take them to the doctor.

The treatments were not showing significant improvement.

During work, I often found myself thinking about what else I could do to help my family member recover more quickly.

My mentor was highly capable and worked at a fast pace.

As a result, the decline in my work quality quickly became apparent to my mentor.

<br>

Faced with this situation, I ultimately decided to resign

To focus on caring for my family

Once my family member's health stabilizes, I will consider my next steps.

I understand that work can be found again, but if I miss this chance to care for my family member's health, I might regret not making this decision.

## [The Significance of Resignation]{.text-lg .font-bold}
<br>

This decision to resign is not only for my family but also for myself to take a much-needed break and work on the blog I've always wanted to complete.

In the five years since I started working, I've always transitioned seamlessly between jobs, never having a true gap year.

Now, this opportunity, born out of my family member's illness, allows me to recharge and better prepare for the next steps in my life.
