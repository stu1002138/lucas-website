This time, to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday,

I specially booked this Japanese Omakase restaurant – Chuyu Sushi.

This restaurant became a favorite of mine after a friend took me here for my birthday once, and I’ve remembered it ever since.

Initially, the meal set at Chuyu Sushi was priced at TWD 1200 +10%.

However, with inflation, the prices have increased as well.

This restaurant is located in the B1 level of Regent Hotel Taipei, near Zhongshan MRT Station.

Before dining, reservations must be made in advance through the [Chuyu Sushi official website](https://www.chu-yu.com.tw/){.text-blue }.

Full payment is required upfront, either via bank transfer or in-store credit card.

Due to limited seating, I recommend booking early to secure your spot!

Once seated, the staff will first serve a cup of hot tea, along with small appetizers and pickles.

Then, the essence of Omakase slowly unfolds, with each dish meticulously crafted and served.

The appetizer is refreshing and whets your appetite, preparing you for the culinary experience ahead.

One by one, the dishes are served.

Although I’ve forgotten most of the specific dish names due to the passage of time, I can confidently say that every dish was fresh and delicious, particularly the seafood used by the restaurant.

Below are some of the dishes we enjoyed during the meal:

The freshness of the ingredients is guaranteed, and each dish is incredibly flavorful.

Midway through, the staff asked if we wanted to add extra lobster or wagyu beef, but since we estimated our portions just right, we declined additional orders.

For the final main course, the restaurant prepares a seafood rice dish.

If you’re still hungry, you can ask for more rice – the service is very considerate.

<br>

At the end of the meal, dessert is served, paired with matcha, perfectly concluding the dining experience.

The dessert is not overly sweet, and with the matcha, it tastes perfect.

Overall, the food is exquisite, the ingredients are fresh, and the service is thoughtful. I highly recommend everyone to come and try it.
